# Save App Breakdown

## Description:
The purpose of this app is to provide a simple easy to use app to help people who don't really know where to start when it comes to saving money.
The user will find a fun, interactive interface that shows them a total amount of money, the time it will take to save that money,
and an array of small amounts of their choosing they can save at given time intervals.
The app will have a user sign in, so their history will be saved, and they can access it from any web browser.
This app will provide people with a clean interface that is easy and free of ads or any type of data tracking.

## Core Features:
- The main interface will show users a plan that will save them $2000 over the course of 1 year. 
They'll find a display of twenty six numbers ranging from 1-100. 
Every 2 weeks they'll pick a number (low if they're low on funds, high if they have excess funds to put away).
When they've put the amount of funds away they can check that number off the board.
There will be an "Amount Saved" and "Amount Remaining" display as well.

- There will be a log in with a user name and password so the user can access their personal board and history at any time.
